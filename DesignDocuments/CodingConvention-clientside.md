## Variable and Function
* Use `camelCase` for variable and function names

> Reason: Conventional JavaScript

**Bad**
```ts
var FooVar;
function BarFunc() { }
```
**Good**
```ts
var fooVar;
function barFunc() { }
```

## Class
* Use `PascalCase` for class names.

> Reason: This is actually fairly conventional in standard JavaScript.

**Bad**
```ts
class foo { }
```
**Good**
```ts
class Foo { }
```
* Use `camelCase` of class members and methods

> Reason: Naturally follows from variable and function naming convention.

**Bad**
```ts
class Foo {
    Bar: number;
    Baz() { }
}
```
**Good**
```ts
class Foo {
    bar: number;
    baz() { }
}
```
## Interface

* Use `PascalCase` for name.

> Reason: Similar to class

* Use `camelCase` for members.

> Reason: Similar to class

* **Don't** prefix with `I`

> Reason: Unconventional. `lib.d.ts` defines important interfaces without an `I` (e.g. Window, Document etc).

**Bad**
```ts
interface IFoo {
}
```
**Good**
```ts
interface Foo {
}
```

## Type

* Use `PascalCase` for name.

> Reason: Similar to class

* Use `camelCase` for members.

> Reason: Similar to class


## Namespace

* Use `PascalCase` for names

> Reason: Convention followed by the TypeScript team. Namespaces are effectively just a class with static members. Class names are `PascalCase` => Namespace names are `PascalCase`

**Bad**
```ts
namespace foo {
}
```
**Good**
```ts
namespace Foo {
}
```

## Enum

* Use `PascalCase` for enum names

> Reason: Similar to Class. Is a Type.

**Bad**
```ts
enum color {
}
```
**Good**
```ts
enum Color {
}
```

* Use `PascalCase` for enum member

> Reason: Convention followed by TypeScript team i.e. the language creators e.g `SyntaxKind.StringLiteral`. Also helps with translation (code generation) of other languages into TypeScript.

**Bad**
```ts
enum Color {
    red
}
```
**Good**
```ts
enum Color {
    Red
}
```

## Null vs. Undefined

* Prefer not to use either for explicit unavailability

> Reason: these values are commonly used to keep a consistent structure between values. In TypeScript you use *types* to denote the structure

**Bad**
```ts
let foo = {x:123,y:undefined};
```
**Good**
```ts
let foo:{x:number,y?:number} = {x:123};
```

* Use `undefined` in general (do consider returning an object like `{valid:boolean,value?:Foo}` instead)

***Bad***
```ts
return null;
```
***Good***
```ts
return undefined;
```

* Use `null` where its a part of the API or conventional

> Reason: It is conventional in Node.js e.g. `error` is `null` for NodeBack style callbacks.

**Bad**
```ts
cb(undefined)
```
**Good**
```ts
cb(null)
```

* Use *truthy* check for **objects** being `null` or `undefined`

**Bad**
```ts
if (error === null)
```
**Good**
```ts
if (error)
```

* Use `== undefined` / `!= undefined` (not `===` / `!==`) to check for `null` / `undefined` on primitives as it works for both `null`/`undefined` but not other falsy values (like `''`,`0`,`false`) e.g.

**Bad**
```ts
if (error !== null)
```
**Good**
```ts
if (error != undefined)
```

## Formatting
The TypeScript compiler ships with a very nice formatting language service. Whatever output it gives by default is good enough to reduce the cognitive overload on the team.

Use [`tsfmt`](https://github.com/vvakame/typescript-formatter) to automatically format your code on the command line. Also your IDE (atom/vscode/vs/sublime) already has formatting support built-in.

Examples:
```ts
// Space before type i.e. foo:<space>string
const foo: string = "hello";
```

## Quotes

* Prefer single quotes (`'`) unless escaping.

> Double quotes are not without merit: Allows easier copy paste of objects into JSON. Allows people to use other languages to work without changing their quote character. Allows you to use apostrophes e.g. `He's not going.`. But I'd rather not deviate from where the JS Community is fairly decided.

* When you can't use double quotes, try using back ticks (\`).

> Reason: These generally represent the intent of complex enough strings.

## Spaces

* Use `4` spaces. Not tabs.


## Array

* Annotate arrays as `foos:Foo[]` instead of `foos:Array<Foo>`.

> Reasons: Its easier to read. Its used by the TypeScript team. Makes easier to know something is an array as the mind is trained to detect `[]`.

## Filename
Name files with `PascalCase`. E.g. `AboutView.ts`.

> Reason: Conventional across many JS teams.

## type vs. interface

* Use `type` when you *might* need a union or intersection:

```
type Foo = number | { someProperty: number }
```
* Use `interface` when you want `extends` or `implements` e.g

```
interface Foo {
  foo: string;
}
interface FooBar extends Foo {
  bar: string;
}
class X implements FooBar {
  foo: string;
  bar: string;
}
```
